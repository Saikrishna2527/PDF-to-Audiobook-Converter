GUI Class:
The PDFtoAudioApp class sets up the user interface and orchestrates key operations:
Upload Button: Lets the user select a PDF file. Displays file name and extracts text.
Volume & Speed Sliders: Allow adjustment of audio playback parameters.
Convert Button: Starts conversion in a background thread, keeping the GUI responsive.
Play Button: Plays the generated audio using the operating systemâ€™s default player (os.startfile on Windows).
Export Button: Copies the output audio file to a user-specified location.
Error Handling:
If no text is found after uploading, an error message appears and conversion/playback are disabled.
File operations use exception handling to report errors to the user via status messages.
The application is structured to guide users through uploading a PDF, converting it to speech, listening to the output, and exporting the result, all through an intuitive interface with robust error handling.
