GUI Class:
1)The PDFtoAudioApp class sets up the user interface and orchestrates key operations:
2)Upload Button: Lets the user select a PDF file. Displays file name and extracts text.
3)Volume & Speed Sliders: Allow adjustment of audio playback parameters.
4)Convert Button: Starts conversion in a background thread, keeping the GUI responsive.
5)Play Button: Plays the generated audio using the operating systemâ€™s default player (os.startfile on Windows).
6)Export Button: Copies the output audio file to a user-specified location.

Error Handling:
If no text is found after uploading, an error message appears and conversion/playback are disabled.
File operations use exception handling to report errors to the user via status messages.
